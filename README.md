# skilz.dev, Develop Your Skills

skilz.dev is focused on providing self-directed learning content related
to a variety of skills (having started originally to promote
foundational learning for technologists). Learning is encapsulated into
badges, each with its own topic and level divisions. All badges have
five levels of depth:

1. Basics (conversant, has sampled and mastered something minimal)
1. Essentials (working knowledge, just enough to explore and be dangerous) 
1. Proficiency (full professional proficiency, could be paid for)
1. Excellence (beyond proficiency, innovative application of)
1. Mastery (domain leader, able to instruct and expound about)

## Publishing a Badge

Anyone can publish their own badge simply by creating a repo on
GitHub with the name `badge-` followed by up to 25 lower-case
ASCII characters (ex: `badge-citizenship-in-the-world`) containing
the name of the badge. (The hard limit on the number of characters in a
title is meant to force creation of terse, memorable names and limit
scope.)

Any GitHub repo with the name described above, that also contains a
`README.md` and `data.yaml` will be automatically detected. 

See [template-badge] for more.

## Mentoring

skilz.dev provides a free (but not guaranteed) service for mentors to
make themselves known to others as a convenience.

Mentors simply create a `mentor.skilz.dev` GitHub repo to submit their
names for inclusion in the mentors directory. (See [template-mentor] for
more.)

Mentors can choose to be paid by those they help or volunteer and must
provide a mentor profile repo containing their information. skilz.dev is
not involved with any payment and never will be. That is strictly
between the mentor and the person learning. 

> ⚠️
> Contacting any mentor is entirely at your own risk. It is up to each
> individual to establish their own trusted relationship with any
> mentor. No entity associated with skilz.dev has done any vetting or
> validation of any mentor. Mentors are encouraged to provide
> their own trust-instruments and credentials to alleviate this risk for
> those whom they would potentially mentor. When in doubt, seek out
> mentors from among people you already know and trust.
